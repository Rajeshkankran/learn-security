# Learn _`IT Security & Privacy`_

Security, Privacy and Data Protection in information technology
systems is **NOT** "_**Optional**_". <br />
And yet, _most_ people prefer to _ignore_ the subject ...

resorting to "[_ignorance is bliss_](https://youtu.be/l5y68ErffgM)"
_convincing_ themselves that the problem will somehow go away.

## _Why_?

For **most** (_small/medium_) **organizations** (_and **many** large ones!_) technology project(s) **security**
is an "[***afterthought***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/afterthought#Noun)", <br />
which people only _consider_ when they
_have_ to; _usually when the "**unthinkable**" (data compromise) happens_...

## _Who_?

_Everyone_ in your organization _**must**_ have a _**security mindset**_! <br />

_Preferably **everyone** in all the organizations you **work/associate with** will have be **security-educated**,
because sadly, (naive/well-meaning) **people** remain the "[**weakest link**](http://www.cio.com/article/2895404/cybercrime/people-remain-the-weakest-link-in-security.html)"_.


## _What_?

> Firstly we must come to terms with the fact that it's **impossible to be 100% secure** because there will
_always_ be "_uncertainty_". That does not mean we should "_give up_"

There are _many_ areas of IT security that people in your team(s) need to be aware of, they include of:

## How?

Sadly there is no "***magic pill***" we can take to make _everything_ secure,
but there are _several_ principals/practices we can follow which will help.
