# Learn _`IT Security & Privacy`_

Security, Privacy and Data Protection in information technology
systems is **NOT** "_**Optional**_". <br />
And yet, _most_ people prefer to _ignore_ the subject ...

resorting to "[_ignorance is bliss_](https://youtu.be/l5y68ErffgM)"
_convincing_ themselves that the problem will somehow go away.

## _Why_?

For _most_ (_small/medium_) **organizations** (_and **many** large ones!_) technology project(s) **security**
is an "[***afterthought***](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/afterthought#Noun)", <br />
which people only _consider_ when they
_have_ to; _usually when the "**unthinkable**" (data compromise) happens_...

## _Who_?

_Everyone_ in your organization _**must**_ have a _**security mindset**_! <br />

_Preferably **everyone** in all the organizations you **work/associate with** will have be **security-educated**,
because sadly, (naive/well-meaning) **people** remain the "[**weakest link**](http://www.cio.com/article/2895404/cybercrime/people-remain-the-weakest-link-in-security.html)"_.


## _What_?

> Firstly we must come to terms with the fact that it's **impossible to be 100% secure** because there will
_always_ be "_uncertainty_". That does not mean we should "_give up_"

There are _many_ areas of IT security that people in your team(s)
need to be aware of, they include:

+ WiFi Safety: https://youtu.be/T5HCy3udooo

## How?

Sadly there is no "***magic pill***" we can take to make _everything_ secure,
but there are _several_ principals/practices we can follow which will help.

### Principal of _Least Priviledge_

> "_Every program and every privileged user of the system should operate
using the **least** amount of **privilege necessary** to complete the job_."

The level of access granted to a person/user or program/script should be
only that necessary for its legitimate purpose. The simple rule of thumb is:
if the person/program only needs read-access don't give it write access.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege

### Never Share User Accounts/Passwords

If you have an account on a system,

> Note: this is why systems that charge per user-account per month
are to be avoided because they _perversely_ incentivize people to
share account in order to avoid paying for more "seats" or "licenses".
